<p>Today, we celebrated the renewal of vows for ten remarkable couples who
have been married for 40 years and more. It’s moments like these that remind
us of the strength and beauty of lifelong partnerships. Congratulations
to each couple for their enduring love and commitment to one another.
<br>
<br>A special acknowledgment goes to Mr. and Mrs. Goh for gracing the occasion
with their beautiful family (pic 2). Witnessing not only their enduring
marriage but also the love shared among their children was heartwarming.
Let us cherish the bonds we create within our families, for they are the
foundation of our community.
<br>
<br>I want to express our sincere appreciation to the Marsiling SCEC, AAC
and WEC for organising this memorable event, which celebrates love and
community spirit. Additionally, I extend my gratitude to Mr. Bob Shaw,
BBM for officiating the renewal of vow ceremony, adding depth and warmth
to the occasion.
