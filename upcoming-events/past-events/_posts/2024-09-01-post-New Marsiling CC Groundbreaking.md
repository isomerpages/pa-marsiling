<p>Today, we took an exciting step forward with the Groundbreaking Ceremony
for the new Marsiling Community Club! This new space will be more than
just a building - it is rejuvenating Marsiling to build a vibrant and inclusive
future.</p>
<p>Are you ready for an experience like no other in 2026?! From a state-of-the-art
performing arts hub to a cutting-edge gym, a community kitchen, and lush
green spaces, the new Marsiling CC is set to become the beating heart of
our neighbourhood. No matter your age or passion, this is where Marsiling
comes alive!</p>
<p>A massive shoutout to everyone who’s been part of this journey - our dedicated
community leaders, tireless volunteers, generous donors, and all our amazing
partners. We’re not just constructing a new CC; we’re building a brighter,
stronger Marsiling!</p>
<p>Let’s keep this momentum going, honouring our roots while forging a future
filled with unity and strength!</p>
