<p>Dear Marsiling Residents,</p>
<p>Marsiling is more than just where we live – it’s a home we build together.
Over the past five years, we’ve worked alongside you to enhance our estate
and strengthen our community spirit.</p>
<p>Thanks to your feedback, we’ve refreshed our neighbourhood with Repair
&amp; Redecoration (R&amp;R) for all blocks and introduced 34 new amenities,
including sheltered linkways, drop-off porches, playgrounds and fitness
corners. Key developments like the Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL), Woodlands
Health Campus, the upgraded Marsiling Market &amp; Hawker Centre, and the
Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP) have made our town more vibrant and connected.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the Marsiling 2030 Masterplan brings even more improvements:
a new Marsiling Community Club, 8 new high linkways, a 16km cycling path,
more EV chargers, and new social programmes to bring families and friends
closer together.</p>
<p>Most importantly, Marsiling thrives because of you – your ideas, feedback,
and community spirit. Let’s continue shaping a caring, connected and future-ready
Marsiling together.</p>
<p>Thank you for being part of this journey!</p>
